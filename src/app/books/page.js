           <><h2>Grit</h2><p>This is a book I read over the summer of 2024. Personally, I would not recommend the book to teenagers,
            because being able to understand what the author is talking about requires a lot of experiences in life, 
            so for me, I only rememberes some points that she was trying to make in the book. However, I would highly recommend
            it to the parents, educators and most of the people who are working. This book really makes me think about how I would
            educate my kids as a father, and how I would teach my students as a professor, to make them be gritty on the things they 
            are trying to do.
