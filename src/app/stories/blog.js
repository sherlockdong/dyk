  content:'I was born in a hospital in Nanjing, China. From then on, I have been living in this city. I grew up in a beautiful residential area. My parents always tell me about how I would have fun with the kids back home. Though now I can barely remember anything that happened back then, I remember the neighborhood, and how me and my parents would usually have fun. There is a playground there. Sometimes, I wish I could go back there and look for some precious memories.',

  title: 'My elementary school - #1',
  content:'One of the first thing I can remember about my elementary school is that, at first I did not like the school at all. I went to an interview from another school which I really like, so when I heard that they rejected me, I was really sad. For several days I could not accept this news. However, I enjoyed my five years in that school -- Nanjing Jinlin High School Hexi Campus. It was big, and because the school was rich, the school was also using some advanced technologies. I really love it there, and I have some friends that we still keep in touch. It is astonishing that now we have been friends for 10 years.',

  content:'There has been several opportunities for me to transfer to the school I wanted to go to, and I did not forfeit any of those. It was Nanjing Foreign Language School Xianlin Campus, arguably the best elementary school in the city, but it is much harder to tranfer than to originally be accepted into, as we have to pass a hard test. I passed it when I was in Grade 5, together with 40 other kids, we form a new class in Grade 6. Though it is only one year, I met some of my closest friends right now. We all share the same goal, which is to go to Nanjing Foreign Language School for middle school. It was hard, so that year was really stressful. We barely had anny free time. In the end, I made it, as well as some of my friends there.'
